## Important Security Notice

This template, the application code and configuration it contains, has been built to showcase Microsoft Azure specific services and tools. We strongly advise our customers not to make this code part of their production environments without implementing or enabling additional security features.

## Features

This project framework provides the following features:

* **Azure AI Foundry Project**: Complete setup of Azure AI Foundry workspace with project configuration
* **Foundry Model Deployments**: Automatic deployment of AI models for agent capabilities
* **Container-Based Agent Hosting**: NLWeb application as Foundry hosted agent for deploying and scaling AI agents
* **Azure Container Registry**: Secure container image storage and management for agent deployments
* **Managed Identity**: Built-in Azure Managed Identity for secure, keyless authentication between services
* **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete Bicep templates for repeatable, version-controlled deployments

## Getting Started

Open in GitHub Codespaces
Open in Dev Containers

1. Clone the repo
2. This repo use the new azd to deploy agent. Please install the latest azd daily build. See Wait for the environment to load
   #### Windows Install
   ```pwsh
   powershell -ex AllSigned -c "Invoke-RestMethod 'https://aka.ms/install-azd.ps1' -OutFile 'install-azd.ps1'; ./install-azd.ps1 -Version 'daily'"
   ```
   #### Verify
   ```pwsh
   azd version
   ```
   It should show ```azd version 1.21.0-beta.1-daily.5539152``` or higher.
3. Run ```azd env new``` in the terminal to create a new environment
4. Run ```azd up``` in the terminal. Follow the prompts to select your Azure subscription and region (choose West US2)
   - The NLWeb agent code is at /app/NLWebAgent. It will build a docker image. Please start the Docker Desktop first.
   - Several features require to opt-in your subscription. Please contact the team to enable your subscriptions.
5. Wait for deployment to complete (5-10 minutes). What it does:
   - Provision AI Foundry Project and Azure AI Search.
   - Load the sample data to Azure AI Search.
   - Deploy NLWeb as the hosted agent in AI Foundry Project.
6. Test using script/nlweb-demo/single_turn_conversation.py and send MCP tools/list request
   ```pwsh
   # create a python venv 
   cd scripts/nlweb-demo
   pip install -r ./requirements.txt
   python ./single_turn_conversation.py
   ```
   It sends MCP request tools/list and you should see the MCP response from the NLWeb agent.



For detailed deployment options and troubleshooting, see the [full deployment guide](./docs/deployment.md).
**After deployment, try these [sample questions](./docs/sample_questions.md) to test your agent.**

## Local Development

For developers who want to run the application locally or customize the agent:

- **[Local Development Guide](./docs/local_development.md)** - Set up a local development environment, customize the frontend (starting with AgentPreview.tsx), modify agent instructions and tools, and use evaluation to improve your code.

This guide covers:
- Environment setup and prerequisites
- Running the development server locally
- Frontend customization and backend communication
- Agent instructions and tools modification
- File management and agent recreation
- Using agent evaluation for code improvement


## Resource Clean-up

To prevent incurring unnecessary charges, it's important to clean up your Azure resources after completing your work with the application.

- **When to Clean Up:**
  - After you have finished testing or demonstrating the application.
  - If the application is no longer needed or you have transitioned to a different project or environment.
  - When you have completed development and are ready to decommission the application.

- **Deleting Resources:**
  To delete all associated resources and shut down the application, execute the following command:
  
    ```bash
    azd down
    ```

    Please note that this process may take up to 20 minutes to complete.

⚠️ Alternatively, you can delete the resource group directly from the Azure Portal to clean up resources.

## Guidance

### Costs

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
The majority of the Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers.

You can try the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) for the resources:

- **Azure AI Foundry**: Free tier. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ai-studio/)  
- **Azure AI Services**: S0 tier, defaults to gpt-4o-mini. Pricing is based on token count. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/)  
- **Log analytics**: Pay-as-you-go tier. Costs based on data ingested. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)  

⚠️ To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

### Security guidelines

This template also uses [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for local development and deployment.

To ensure continued best practices in your own repository, we recommend that anyone creating solutions based on our templates ensure that the [Github secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) setting is enabled.

You may want to consider additional security measures, such as:

- Enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud to [secure your Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/).
- Protecting the Azure Container Apps instance with a [firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) and/or [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli).

### Resources

This template creates everything you need to get started with Azure AI Foundry:

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Azure AI Project](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-projects) | Provides a collaborative workspace for AI development with access to models, data, and compute resources |
| [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/) | Powers the AI agents for conversational AI and intelligent search capabilities. Default models deployed are gpt-4o-mini, but any Azure AI models can be specified per the [documentation](docs/deploy_customization.md#customizing-model-deployments) |
| [Azure Container Registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/) | Stores and manages container images for secure deployment |
| [AI Search Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/) | *Optional* - Enables hybrid search capabilities combining semantic and vector search |
| [Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) | *Optional* - Provides application performance monitoring, logging, and telemetry for debugging and optimization |
