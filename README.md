## Solution Overview

This solution deploys a web-based NLWeb chat application with an AI agent running in Azure Container App.

## Getting Started

Open in GitHub Codespaces
Open in Dev Containers

1. Click `Open in GitHub Codespaces` or `Dev Containers` button above
2. Wait for the environment to load
3. Run the following commands in the terminal:
   ```bash
   azd up
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to select your Azure subscription and region
5. Wait for deployment to complete (5-10 minutes) - you'll get Azure Foundry Project URL and Azure AI Search URL when finished
6. TODO: Load sample data to Azure AI Search
7. TODO: Deploy NLWeb Hosted Agent using azd command or python script create_agent
8. TODO: Test in the console script

For detailed deployment options and troubleshooting, see the [full deployment guide](./docs/deployment.md).
**After deployment, try these [sample questions](./docs/sample_questions.md) to test your agent.**

## Local Development

For developers who want to run the application locally or customize the agent:

- **[Local Development Guide](./docs/local_development.md)** - Set up a local development environment, customize the frontend (starting with AgentPreview.tsx), modify agent instructions and tools, and use evaluation to improve your code.

This guide covers:
- Environment setup and prerequisites
- Running the development server locally
- Frontend customization and backend communication
- Agent instructions and tools modification
- File management and agent recreation
- Using agent evaluation for code improvement


## Resource Clean-up

To prevent incurring unnecessary charges, it's important to clean up your Azure resources after completing your work with the application.

- **When to Clean Up:**
  - After you have finished testing or demonstrating the application.
  - If the application is no longer needed or you have transitioned to a different project or environment.
  - When you have completed development and are ready to decommission the application.

- **Deleting Resources:**
  To delete all associated resources and shut down the application, execute the following command:
  
    ```bash
    azd down
    ```

    Please note that this process may take up to 20 minutes to complete.

⚠️ Alternatively, you can delete the resource group directly from the Azure Portal to clean up resources.

## Guidance

### Costs

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
The majority of the Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers.

You can try the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) for the resources:

- **Azure AI Foundry**: Free tier. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ai-studio/)  
- **Azure AI Services**: S0 tier, defaults to gpt-4o-mini. Pricing is based on token count. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/)  
- **Log analytics**: Pay-as-you-go tier. Costs based on data ingested. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)  

⚠️ To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

### Security guidelines

This template also uses [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for local development and deployment.

To ensure continued best practices in your own repository, we recommend that anyone creating solutions based on our templates ensure that the [Github secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) setting is enabled.

You may want to consider additional security measures, such as:

- Enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud to [secure your Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/).
- Protecting the Azure Container Apps instance with a [firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) and/or [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli).

> **Important Security Notice** <br/>
This template, the application code and configuration it contains, has been built to showcase Microsoft Azure specific services and tools. We strongly advise our customers not to make this code part of their production environments without implementing or enabling additional security features.  <br/><br/>
For a more comprehensive list of best practices and security recommendations for Intelligent Applications, [visit our official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/).
